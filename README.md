A Notebook app where you can create notebook and notes inside it. This a pretty simple but functional app to save your notes...


## Main goals for the v1.0

The main goal for this version is to create an app to access a local storage through Realm framework. This app should keep as simple as it can but at same time, up to date on how to implement correctly data base access and non bloking UI.

### This app will implement:
- [X] Realm Framework
- [X] DispatchQueue
- [X] NIB file (for v1.0)
- [X] MVVM
- [X] Coordinator

<br />

```
For more details on how to use Realm Framework, please check its official documentation https://realm.io
